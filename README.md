# üéôÔ∏è Voice Booking Assistant

## Project Overview
The Voice Booking Assistant is a Python-based voice automation agent that allows users to interact using voice commands to manage their calendar. Users can:
- List upcoming calendar events.
- Book new appointments.
- Cancel existing appointments.

The assistant uses OpenAI GPT-5 for natural language understanding, Google Calendar API for scheduling, and speech recognition for voice input. It also provides a modern, interactive GUI built with CustomTkinter.
